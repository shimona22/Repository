The embedded system models an entrance tracking system using a Raspberry Pi, laser diodes and photodiodes, to quantify the times the laser beam is broken in order to count the objects that enters and exits the system. The software was developed in C, using a Linux environment that was run on a Virtual Machine. I also incorporate a watchdog timer, file I/O and a startup script to automatically run the program when the Pi boots.
